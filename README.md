# Matplotlib-Homework

Observations and Insights
1,Dependencies and Setup
2,Study data files
3,Read the mouse data and the study results
4,Combine the data into a single dataset
5,Display the data table for preview
6,Checking the number of mice.
7,Getting the duplicate mice by ID number that shows up for Mouse ID and Timepoint. 
8,Get all the data for the duplicate mouse ID. 
9,Create a clean DataFrame by dropping the duplicate mouse by its ID.
10,Checking the number of mice in the clean DataFrame.


Summary Statistics
1,Use groupby and summary statistical methods to calculate the following properties of each drug regimen: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume. 
2,Assemble the resulting series into a single summary dataframe.
3,Using the aggregation method, produce the same summary statistics in a single line

Bar and Pie Charts
1,Generate a bar plot showing the total number of unique mice tested on each drug regimen using pandas.
2,filter the data frame
3,set the index, set titles
4,print chart and set layout

1,Generate a bar plot showing the total number of unique mice tested on each drug regimen using pyplot.
2,convert column and counts to list
3,set up x axis and create a chart

1,Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using pandas
2,filter the data frame
3,set up ax1 and create a chart

1,Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using pyplot
2,create the pie chart

1,Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin
